A web app that plays music according to your emotional needs and helps you recharge your mental health with an altogether new and different listening experience. Often times, we are not able to communicate through words how we feel, and rhythMind helps just there! It detects your emotion from your face, and suggests a number from tracks based on it, or lets you join chat rooms where you can chat with people feeling similar options. After detecting your emotion, it tracks your mood and shows an interactive chart on your emotions. You can also like suggested songs or playlists and listen to them later!


# Features

Surprise </br>
Sadness </br>
Happiness </br>

3) *Music Player*, suggests music using the Spotify API depending on the user's emotion. As user is logged in using their account, the songs suggested are personlized according to the region they live in, i.e if someone lives in India, they will be mostly suggested Bollywood songs.  These songs are played in the web browser itself without going to Spotify's page.The user can easily share the songs with their friends/family on Facebook, Twitter or whatsapp. User can also like the songs or playlists.</br>

4) *Chat Room*, where user can talk to other people feeling the same emotions. this chat room provides a safe space, allowing only users from whose picture that emotion is detected to enter the room. In different rooms, different background music also plays according to the mood of the chat room.
